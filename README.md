# ðŸ§  Multi-Agent AI System â€” Built by Pranshi Gupta

An intelligent multi-agent system designed to classify input files (Email, JSON, PDF), detect their intent (e.g., RFQ, Invoice, Complaint), and route them to the appropriate agent. Each agent performs specialized tasks and logs data into a shared memory for traceability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To simulate a lightweight, modular AI-powered system capable of:

- Understanding file **format** and **intent**
- Routing input to a specialized agent (Email or JSON agent)
- Extracting relevant fields (sender, urgency, missing fields, etc.)
- Storing interaction context for end-to-end traceability
